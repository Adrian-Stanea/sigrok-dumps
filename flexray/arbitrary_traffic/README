Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a Dreamsoucelab DSLogic Plus at a sample rate of
100MHz.

The hardware used for generating the communication was an Intrepid FlexRay
Evaluation Board.
FlexFray controller: Fujitsu MB88121C (Bosch E-Ray IP)
Bus Transceiver: Elmos E910.54B

Product info:
https://store.intrepidcs.com/FlexRay-EVB-p/flexray-evb.htm

The software used was Intrepid Vehicle Spy for FlexRay running under Windows 7.
The data has been generated by using software version is 3.5.0.19, neoVI DLL
version is 3.5.1.29.

The software and hardware are end of life products and are not available
anymore by the manufacturer.

The logic analyzer probes were hooked up to the RX pins of the Elmos E910.53B
logic level transceivers. Channel 0 was hooked up to FlexRay channel A and
channel 1 was hooked up to FlexRay channel B. Channel A and B of both FlexRay
controllers are connected together.

The bus was externally terminated by adding a 100 Ohm resistor between FR_A+
and FR_A- and another 100 Ohm resistor between FR_B+ and FR_B-.
