TrekStor eBook Reader 3.0 I2C
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a set of example captures of the I2C traffic on a TrekStor eBook
Reader 3.0 EBR30-a (Weltbild + Hugendubel Edition) device.

For details on the device see:

There are three chips which are connected to the main CPU's SCL/SDA pins.
So far, it's unknown which device is responsible for which I2C output.

----------------------------

The logic analyzer used for capturing was a ChronoVu LA8:

  Probe       I2C pin
  -------------------
  1 (orange)  SCL
  7 (yellow)  SDA

The sigrok command line used was:

  sigrok-cli -d 0:samplerate=4mhz --samples 8388608 \
             -p '2=SCL,8=SDA' -o trekstor_ebr30_a_i2c_0x15.sr


trekstor_ebr30_a_i2c_30s.sr
---------------------------

This is a 30 second dump of the I2C traffic while the device was attached
to USB.

The logic analyzer used for capturing was a Saleae Logic:

  Probe       I2C pin
  -------------------
  4 (orange)  SCL
  6 (green)   SDA

The sigrok command line used was:

  sigrok-cli -d 0:samplerate=4mhz --time 120s
             -p '4=SCL,6=SDA' -o trekstor_ebr30_a_i2c_30s.sr
