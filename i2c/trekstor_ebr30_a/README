TrekStor eBook Reader 3.0 I2C
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an example capture of the I2C traffic on a TrekStor eBook Reader 3.0
EBR30-a (Weltbild + Hugendubel Edition) device.

For details on the device see:

There are three chips which are connected to the main CPU's SCL/SDA pins.
So far, it's unknown which device is responsible for which I2C output.


Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used for capturing is a ChronoVu LA8 at a sample rate
of 4MHz.

The ChronoVu LA8 probes were connected to the I2C pins like this:

  Probe       I2C pin
  -------------------
  1 (orange)  SCL
  7 (yellow)  SDA
  GND         GND


Data

The sigrok command line used was:

  sigrok-cli -d 0:samplerate=4mhz --samples 8388608 \
             -p '2=SCL,8=SDA' -o trekstor_ebr30_a_i2c_0x15.sr
