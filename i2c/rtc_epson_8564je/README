Epson 8564JE I2C RTC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This an example capture of I2C traffic from/to an Epson 8564JE I2C RTC chip.


Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used for capturing was a ChronoVu LA8 at a sample rate
of 1MHz. The logic analyzer probes were connected to the RTC chip like this:

  Probe       RTC chip pin
  ------------------------
  0 (green)   SCL
  6 (blue)    SDA
  GND         GND


Data
----

The device talking to the RTC was doing the following in an infinite loop:

 - Set the RTC to a specific date/time (Nov 22, 2011 - 04:03:54, weekday = 2).

 - Read back the current time from the RTC.

The sigrok command line used was:

  sigrok-cli -d 0:samplerate=1mhz --samples 8388608 \
             -p '1=SCL,7=SDA,2-6,8' -o rtc_epson_8564je.sr
