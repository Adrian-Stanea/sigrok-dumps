Epson 8564JE I2C RTC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This an example capture of I2C traffic from/to an Epson 8564JE I2C RTC chip,
which has a slave address of 0x51 (or 0xa2, if the read/write bit is included).


Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used for capturing was a ChronoVu LA8 at a sample rate
of 1MHz. The logic analyzer probes were connected to the RTC chip like this:

  Probe       RTC chip pin
  ------------------------
  0 (green)   SCL
  1 (orange)  SDA
  GND         GND


Data
----

The device talking to the RTC was doing the following in an infinite loop:

 - Set the RTC to a specific date/time (Nov 22, 2011 - 04:03:54, weekday = 2).

 - Read back the current time from the RTC.

This is what the decoded data should look like:

 - Setting the date/time:
   S Wr:0xa2 A 0x02 A 0x54 A 0x03 A 0x04 A 0x22 A 0x02 A 0x11 A 0x11 A P

 - Reading the current date/time:
   S Wr:0xa2 A 0x02 A Sr Rd:0xa3 A 0x54 A 0x03 A 0x44 A 0x62 A 0x52 A
   0x51 A 0x11 N P

 - The abbrevations used above: S = Start, Wr = Write, A = ACK, P = Stop,
   Sr = Repeated start, Rd = Read, N = NACK

The sigrok command line used was:

  sigrok-cli -d 0:samplerate=1mhz --samples 8388608 \
             -p '1=SCL,2=SDA' -o rtc_epson_8564je.sr
