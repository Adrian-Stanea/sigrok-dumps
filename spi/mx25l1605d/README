This is an example capture of a Macronix MX25L1605D (MX25L1605DPI-12G)
SPI flash chip (16MBit == 2Mbyte; NOR flash) that is being written to.

The SPI programmer hardware used is openbiosprog-spi, see

  http://randomprojects.org/wiki/Openbiosprog-spi

The software used for programming it is flashrom, see

  http://flashrom.org/FT2232SPI_Programmer

The command line used was

  flashrom -p ft2232_spi:type=2232H,port=A -w filename

where 'filename' is a 2MByte file filled with lots of consecutive "HelloWorld"
ASCII character strings.

The logic analyzer used for capturing is a ChronoVu LA8 at a sample rate
of 25MHz. The capture was done using sigrok (11/2011) via

  sigrok-cli -d 0:samplerate=25mhz --samples 8388608 \
             -p '1=CS#,2=MISO,3=SCLK,4=MOSI,5=WP#,6=HOLD#' \
             -o mx25l1605d_write_hello_world.sigrok

The ChronoVu LA8 probes were connected like this to the MX25L1605D chip:

  Probe       SPI chip pin
  ------------------------
  0 (green)   CS#
  1 (orange)  SO/SIO1 (a.k.a MISO)
  2 (white)   SCLK
  3 (red)     SI/SIO0 (a.k.a MOSI)
  4 (gray)    WP#/ACC
  5 (brown)   HOLD#
  GND         GND

The capture is only partial, it contains a small part of the write process
(it does not contain the chip identification, chip erase, etc. which comes
before the actual write parts; it also does not contain anything after that,
the flashrom command took quite a bit longer than what the capture shows).
