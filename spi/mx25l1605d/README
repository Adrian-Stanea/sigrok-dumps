This is an example capture of a Macronix MX25L1605D (MX25L1605DPI-12G)
SPI flash chip (16MBit == 2Mbyte; NOR flash) that is being written to.

The SPI programmer hardware used is openbiosprog-spi, see

  http://randomprojects.org/wiki/Openbiosprog-spi

The software used for programming it is flashrom, see

  http://flashrom.org/FT2232SPI_Programmer

The command line used was

  flashrom -p ft2232_spi:type=2232H,port=A -w filename

where 'filename' is a 2MByte file filled with lots of consecutive "HelloWorld"
ASCII character strings.

The logic analyzer used for capturing is a Saleae Logic at a sample rate
of 2MHz. The capture was done using sigrok (02/2011) via

  sigrok-cli -d 0:samplerate=2MHz --time 5s -o foo

The Saleae Logic probes were connected like this to the MX25L1605D chip:

  Probe       SPI chip pin
  ------------------------
  1 (black)   CS#
  2 (brown)   SO/SIO1 (a.k.a MISO)
  3 (red)     SCLK
  4 (orange)  SI/SIO0 (a.k.a MOSI)
  5 (yellow)  WP#/ACC
  6 (green)   HOLD#
  GND         GND

The capture is only partial, it contains 5 seconds of the write process
(it does not contain the chip identification, chip erase, etc. which comes
before the actual write parts; it also does not contain anything after those
5 seconds, the flashrom command took quite a bit longer than 5 seconds).
