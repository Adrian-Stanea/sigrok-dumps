These captures are artifically generated CAN-FD messages and are not capturing
specific vehicle or industrial protocols.

Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a Dreamsoucelab DSLogic Plus.

Channel 0 was hooked up to a PEAK-PCAN-USB Pro CAN-FD device which has two
CAN ports. Both ports were connected together using a selfmade circuit board.

The bus was externally terminated by adding a 120 Ohm resistor between CAN_L
and CAN_H.

The data has been generated using PEAK PCAN-View v4.2.1.533 software running
under Windows 7. Firmware on PCAN-USB Pro was v3.2.0. Driver version was 4.1.4.
Both ports were opened by running two instances of the software. One for each
port. All ACKs were handled by the participants.


can_fd_without_brs_8.sr
-----------------------

This shows a single CAN-FD message with 8 Bytes of data without
Bitrate Switch (BRS).

Nominal bitrate: 1M (CLK: 80MHz, BRP: 10, TSeg1: 5, Tseg2: 2, Sjw: 1, SPP: 75%)
Data bitrate: 2M (ignored, since BRS is disabled)
Extended frame: no
BRS: no
11898-1 ISO-mode: on
ID: 0x42
Length: 8 bytes
Data is counting up from 0x00 to 0x07.


can_fd_without_brs_64.sr
------------------------

This shows a single CAN-FD message with 64 bytes of data without
Bitrate Switch (BRS).

Nominal bitrate: 1M (CLK: 80MHz, BRP: 10, TSeg1: 5, Tseg2: 2, Sjw: 1, SPP: 75%)
Data bitrate: 2M (Ignored, since BRS is disabled)
Extended frame: No
BRS: no
11898-1 ISO-mode: on
ID: 0x42
Length: 64 bytes
Data is counting up from 0x00 to 0x3F.
