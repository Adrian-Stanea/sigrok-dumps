This directory contains waveforms created by accesing various onewire devices
using the 'sockit_owm' Verilog master. The master is used in a demo hardware
(Terasic DE1 development board, and a Quartus/Qsys project) and software (also
available as a Nios II project) implementation available at the next GIT repo.
