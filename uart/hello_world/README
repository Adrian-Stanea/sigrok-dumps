Hello World UART output using various options
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a collection of example UART communication (only in one direction).
The repeatedly transmitted data is "Hello World!\r\n", using 8n1 settings.


Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used for capturing is a ChronoVu LA8 at a sample rate
of 5MHz (for baud rates 921600 - 230400), 1MHz (for 115200 - 19200),
and 625kHz (for baud rates 9600 - 110).

The ChronoVu LA8 probes were connected to the UART like this:

  Probe       UART
  -------------------
  0 (green)   TX
  GND         GND


Data
----

The sigrok command line used was:

  sigrok-cli -d 0:samplerate=<hz> --samples 8388608 -p '1=TX' -o <file>.sr

We capture as many samples as fit into the 8MByte buffer of the logic analyzer.
