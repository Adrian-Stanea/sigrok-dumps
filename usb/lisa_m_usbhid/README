Lisa/M USB HID example (USB Full-Speed and SPI)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This capture is taken from the libopencm3 example for a USB HID device on the
Paparazzi Lisa/M board.  In this applicaton an SPI accellerometer is read and
the values are transmitted on a USB IN endpoint as mouse movement.

Logic Analyser setup
--------------------

The capture was taken using the Openbench Logic Sniffer at a sample rate 
of 50MHz.

  Probe    Signal
  -------------------
  0        USB_DM
  1        USB_DP
  2        SPI_NCS
  3        SPI_SCK
  4        SPI_MOSI
  5        SPI_MISO

The command line used was:

sigrok-cli -d 0:samplerate=50mhz:rle=on \
        -p 1=USB_DM,2=USB_DP,3=SPI_NCS,4=SPI_SCK,5=SPI_MOSI,6=SPI_MISO \
        --time=50ms -o lisa_m_usb_spi.sr

The OLS can't actually capture 50ms, so it just captures as much as it can
buffer.  No triggering was used.
