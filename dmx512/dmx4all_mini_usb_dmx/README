DMX512-A
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a set of example captures of DMX512 packets from a USB
interface (DMX4ALL Mini interface), driven by a lighting control
software loaded with 10 basic dimmer fixtures located at DMX addresses
1, 2, 101, 102, 201, 202, 301, 302, 401 and 402.

The signal was grabbed directly at the interface without any actual
fixtures attached to the bus.

Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a Saleae Logic (at various sample rates):

  Probe       3-pin XLR DMX connector
  -----------------------------------
  0           DMX+ (3)
  1           DMX- (2)

The sigrok command line used was:

  sigrok-cli --driver fx2lafw -c samplerate=<samplerate> --time 1s \
             --channels '0=DMX,1=DMX Inverse' \
             -o <samplerate>_all_<dmxvalue>.sr

with <dmxvalue> being the dimmer level of all fixtures.

Note: While "--time 1s" was used to create the files, they have
retroactively been shortened to roughly 40ms each.
